My first pet project (2015)
I've created this very simple desktop app to train my newly acquired java skills.
The project was created with Java SE 6 and NetBeans.
The coding here is of the poor quality and mostly without any comments.

There won't be any updates on this app, however I might recreate it while learning C#.
